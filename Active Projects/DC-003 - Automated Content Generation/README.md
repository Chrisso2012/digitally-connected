# DC-003 — Automated Content Generation

Project foundation for the AI content factory: one approved topic in, a six-slide
Templated carousel out. This directory currently contains the foundation
established by DC-003-I001 (configuration, template registry, JSON schemas)
plus the reusable configuration-loading and validation runtime added in
DC-003-I002. No content generation, payload mapping, rendering, or n8n
workflow logic exists yet.

Lives at `Active Projects/DC-003 - Automated Content Generation/` inside the
`digitally-connected` repository.

## Authoritative documents

This repository implements the following approved specifications. They are
the source of truth for *why* things are shaped the way they are — this
README describes what's actually in the repo, not the reasoning behind it.

- **DC-003-T001 — AI Content Factory Architecture** (approved) — system
  components, data flow, API interaction sequence, error handling.
- **DC-003-T002 — Data & Metadata Specification** (approved) — the five core
  objects (Topic Package, Carousel Content Object, Templated Payload Object,
  Finished Carousel Object, Execution Log), versioning strategy, naming
  conventions, storage strategy.

`prompts/` and `workflows/` are created empty (via `.gitkeep`) because the
architecture in DC-003-T001 names them as the homes for the LLM prompt and
the exported n8n workflow — both explicitly out of scope for every task so far.

## Configuration

Four files, one concern each:

| File | Concern | Contains secrets? |
|---|---|---|
| `config/env.example` | LLM and Templated credentials, runtime settings | No — copy to `.env` and fill in real values; `.env` is gitignored |
| `config/templates.json` | The template registry — see below | No |
| `config/constants.json` | Shared enums and fixed values (slide types, statuses, ID prefixes) used by both schemas and future code | No |
| `config/versions.json` | Current schema/design-system/prompt version identifiers, per DC-003-T002 §6 | No |

### Deviation from DC-003-T001, with reason

DC-003-T001 originally proposed the six Templated template IDs as environment
variables. Implementing the template registry (DC-003-T002 deliverable 3)
made it clear they belong in version-controlled `config/templates.json`
instead: template IDs are not secrets, and keeping them in git means a
template swap is a reviewable diff rather than an untracked deployment
change — and it lets `template_version` travel with `template_id` in one
place, matching the versioning strategy in DC-003-T002 §6. `env.example`
notes this explicitly so the discrepancy with T001 isn't silently invisible.

### Open item from DC-003-T002, now resolved

DC-003-T002 §3 flagged the Infographic template's `step_1..4_icon` layers as
unconfirmed. Re-checked against the live template during this task: they are
static `shape` layers, not `image_url` layers. `config/templates.json`
reflects this — no LLM or mapper ever needs to supply icon content.

## Template registry

`config/templates.json` is the single source of truth for the six DC-002
templates: `template_id`, display `name`, slide position, background,
dimensions, render format, a manually-maintained `template_version` label,
and — per slide — every layer split into `variable` (written by a future
Payload Mapper from a Carousel Content Object) and `fixed` (brand-owned,
never touched). This is the DC-002 "template IDs + variable mappings" asset
carried forward as reviewable config, exactly as DC-003-T001 §7 intended.

## Schemas

Five [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) (2020-12) documents in
`schemas/`, one per object defined in DC-003-T002. Each schema is standards-
compliant so a full validator (e.g. Ajv) can consume it unchanged later. Two
simplifications were made deliberately, to avoid the complexity DC-003-T002's
constraints explicitly warned against:

- **Carousel Content Object** — each slide's `content` field is typed as a
  generic object rather than a `slide_type`-conditional schema (`cover` needs
  different fields than `infographic`). The per-type field list is documented
  in DC-003-T002 §2 and mirrored in `config/templates.json`'s `variable`
  layer lists; enforcing it as JSON Schema `if`/`then` logic is deferred to
  when the Payload Mapper is actually built.
- **Templated Payload Object** — `layers` is typed as a generic object rather
  than enumerating every possible layer key, since the valid key set is
  per-template config, not a schema concern.

## Configuration loader (`src/config-loader.mjs`)

Loads `config/templates.json`, `config/constants.json`, and
`config/versions.json` and returns them as one structured object:

```js
import { loadConfig } from "./src/index.mjs";

const { templates, constants, versions } = loadConfig();
```

Individual loaders (`loadTemplatesConfig`, `loadConstants`, `loadVersions`)
are also exported for callers that only need one file. Behavior:

- **Path resolution** is always relative to the project root (resolved from
  `import.meta.url`, never the process's current working directory), so the
  loader works the same regardless of where it's invoked from.
- **Fails fast**: a missing file throws `ConfigFileNotFoundError`; malformed
  JSON throws `ConfigParseError` with the file path and the underlying parse
  error. Nothing is ever silently defaulted or partially loaded.
- **Never touches `config/env.example`.** That file documents which
  environment variables a deployment needs — it is not a source of runtime
  values. `config-loader.mjs` has no code path that reads it, by design (see
  "Configuration vs. credentials" below).
- Every loader accepts an optional `{ rootDir }` so tests can point it at an
  isolated temporary directory instead of real project config — this is how
  the missing-file and malformed-JSON tests work without touching production
  config files.

## Schema registry (`src/schema-registry.mjs`)

Loads the five approved schemas and exposes them behind stable, camelCase
identifiers rather than filesystem paths:

```js
import { loadSchemaRegistry } from "./src/index.mjs";

const schemas = loadSchemaRegistry();
schemas.topicPackage;      // schemas/topic-package.schema.json, parsed
schemas.carouselContent;   // schemas/carousel-content.schema.json, parsed
schemas.templatedPayload;
schemas.finishedCarousel;
schemas.executionLog;
```

Same fail-fast behavior as the config loader (`ConfigFileNotFoundError` /
`ConfigParseError`), same `{ rootDir }` override for tests.

## Validation runtime (`src/validator.mjs`)

The single source of truth for validating any object against any registered
schema. Built on [Ajv](https://ajv.js.org/) (2020-12 dialect, via
`ajv/dist/2020.js`) plus `ajv-formats` — see "Dependencies" below for why
these two.

```js
import { createValidator } from "./src/index.mjs";

const validator = createValidator();
const result = validator.validate("topicPackage", someObject);
// { valid: true, errors: [] }
// or
// { valid: false, errors: [{ path, keyword, message, params }, ...] }
```

- **Valid data** → `{ valid: true, errors: [] }`.
- **Invalid data** → `{ valid: false, errors: [...] }`, one entry per failed
  rule, each with the JSON Pointer `path` to the offending field (`(root)` if
  the whole object), the failed `keyword` (`required`, `enum`, `type`, ...),
  and a specific, readable `message` — never a bare "validation failed".
- **Unknown schema identifier** → throws `UnknownSchemaError` immediately,
  rather than returning `{ valid: false }`. Passing a schema ID that doesn't
  exist is a caller bug, not a data problem, so it fails loudly and
  immediately instead of being reported alongside real validation errors.

## Existing validator (`tests/validation/validate.mjs`)

The DC-003-I001 validator was a small hand-rolled, dependency-free JSON
Schema subset checker. DC-003-I002 replaced its internals: it is now a thin
CLI wrapper that imports `createValidator()` from `src/validator.mjs` and
prints a PASS/FAIL line per fixture. It has no validation logic of its own —
`src/validator.mjs` is the single source of truth, per this task's
instruction to avoid maintaining two independent implementations.

```bash
npm run validate
```

## Configuration integrity checks (`src/integrity-checks.mjs`)

`runIntegrityChecks(config)` takes an already-loaded config object (from
`loadConfig()`) and checks the *relationships* JSON Schema alone can't
express — structural validity is the schema registry's job, this is
semantic. It collects every issue rather than stopping at the first one:

- all six slide types (`cover`, `content`, `statistic`, `quote`,
  `infographic`, `cta`) exist in the template registry, and are cross-checked
  against `config/constants.json`'s `slide_types` list
- every template has a unique `template_id`
- every template has a valid, non-empty internal key
- every template has all required metadata fields present
- `config/versions.json` has every version identifier DC-003-T002 §6 expects
  (`project_version`, `design_system_version`, `template_registry_version`,
  `schema_versions.*`, and the `prompt_version` key — which may be `null`
  until a prompt exists, but must be present)
- every non-nullable version value is a non-empty string
- no field whose name looks like a credential (`api_key`, `secret`,
  `password`, `token`, `credential`) has a non-empty value anywhere in
  `config/templates.json`, `config/constants.json`, or `config/versions.json`
- the Infographic template's `step_1..4_icon` layers are still listed as
  `fixed` shape layers, not `variable` — guarding against the DC-003-T002
  open item regressing

```js
import { loadConfig, runIntegrityChecks } from "./src/index.mjs";

const report = runIntegrityChecks(loadConfig());
// { ok: true, issues: [] }  or  { ok: false, issues: [{ check, message }, ...] }
```

## Configuration vs. credentials

Two categories, never mixed:

- **Configuration** — `config/templates.json`, `config/constants.json`,
  `config/versions.json`. Not secret. Version-controlled. Loaded by
  `src/config-loader.mjs`.
- **Credentials** — an LLM API key, the Templated API key. Never
  version-controlled. `config/env.example` documents *which* environment
  variables a deployment needs; it holds no real values and is not read by
  any code in this repository. Real values belong in a local `.env`
  (gitignored) or the deployment platform's secret store — neither of which
  this task creates or touches. `runIntegrityChecks` actively scans
  configuration for anything that looks like a stray credential.

## Running tests

Two independent commands, both using Node's built-in `node:test` runner —
no test framework dependency was added:

```bash
npm test       # unit tests: tests/unit/*.test.mjs
npm run validate  # CLI summary: all 5 approved fixtures against their schemas
```

`npm test` covers: successful loading of all config files and all schemas,
every approved fixture validating successfully, malformed-JSON handling,
missing-file handling, an intentionally invalid fixture being rejected with
structured errors, an unknown schema identifier throwing, duplicate
`template_id` detection, missing required version identifier detection, and
a stray-credential detection. Tests that need a "broken" file use a
`node:fs` temporary directory (`mkdtempSync` in the OS temp dir) or an
in-memory `structuredClone()` of the real config — **no test ever writes to
or modifies a file under `config/` or `schemas/`.**

## Expected error behavior

| Situation | What happens |
|---|---|
| A config or schema file is missing | `ConfigFileNotFoundError`, naming the exact path |
| A config or schema file has malformed JSON | `ConfigParseError`, naming the path and the underlying JSON parser error |
| Data fails schema validation | `{ valid: false, errors: [...] }` — never thrown, never a bare boolean, never a generic message |
| An unregistered schema identifier is requested | `UnknownSchemaError`, thrown immediately, listing the valid identifiers |
| A configuration integrity relationship is violated | `{ ok: false, issues: [...] }` from `runIntegrityChecks` — every issue found, not just the first |

## Dependencies

Two, both added in DC-003-I002, both maintained and widely used:

- **`ajv`** (2020-12 dialect) — the JSON Schema validator itself. Explicitly
  requested by this task over the I001 hand-rolled subset validator.
- **`ajv-formats`** — registers `format` keywords (`date-time`, `email`) that
  the five schemas already declare; without it those formats are silently
  unchecked. Required for Ajv's strict mode to accept the schemas as-is.

No test framework was added — `node:test` and `node:assert/strict` (both
built into Node.js 18+) cover every test in this task.
